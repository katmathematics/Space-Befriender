# Space Befriender - A GMTK Jam 2023 Game

## Description:
A twist on space invaders where you're the alien "menace" made for the GMTK 2023 Jam, which had the theme "Roles Reversed."

The game has you playing the alien Kisqi, the lone survivor of the armada sent to befriend humanity. Kisqi must zig zag across the screen to eventually reach the bottom while evading fire from below. The game currently uses a high-score format, test how many times you can survive the descent!
